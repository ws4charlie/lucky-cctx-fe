## 🎲 How It Works

### 📅 Weekly Draws
Based on statistics, we select winners from the pool of CCTX every week

### 🏅 Multiple Winning Categories
- **🎲 Lucky CCTX** - Randomly selected CCTXs (VRF-powered)
<br />

- **⚡ Finality Flash** - Fastest CCTX finality time per chain
<br />

- **🐢 Tortoise Trophy** - Slowest CCTX finality time per chain
<br />


- **👻 Gas Ghost** - Lowest gas fee CCTX per chain


### Other potential Winning Categories

- **User pay highest gas fee**
<br />

- **Most Frequent user**
<br />

- **User hit all connected chains**

<br />
<br />

## 🎳 Unpredictable & Fair

Winners are unpredictable because:
- **🎲 Random Selection** - VRF (Verifiable Random Function) ensures true randomness
<br />

- **⏱️ CCTX Metrics** - Transaction speed and gas prices are unpredictable

<br />
<br />

## 💰 Reward Token: rwZETA

- **🔧 Flexible** - rwZETA is pegged to ZETA but allows for customization
<br />

- **🔄 Conversion Rate** - Configurable rate between rwZETA and ZETA
<br />

- **🚀 Future Expansion** - Possibility for staking rewards before claiming

<br />
<br />


## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Three-Component System

1. **🖥️ Off-chain Admin Service** (Centralized)
   - Analyzes CCTX statistics weekly
   - Selects winners based on configured metrics
   - Submits winner data to smart contract

2. **📜 Smart Contract** (Decentralized)
   - Stores winner information securely on-chain
   - Manages reward distribution
   - Provides transparent reward history

3. **🌍 User-Friendly Frontend** (Decentralized Interface)
   - Displays winners by category
   - Shows leaderboards for top earners
   - Allows winners to claim rewards with MetaMask
