## 🤔 What is Fortune Cookie?

Fortune Cookie is a ZetaHub extension that adds a layer of excitement to cross-chain transactions by rewarding users based on various metrics.

- **1. 🏆 Weekly rewards:** for users performing cross-chain transactions (CCTXs)

- **2. 🎮 Gamifies the ZetaChain experience** and enhances user engagement
<br />
- **3. 🤝 Creates a lively community atmosphere** by adding an element of chance and skill
<br />
- **4. 📣 Supports ZetaChain's marketing efforts** by incentivizing specific CCTXs.

<br />
> 🍪 Just like a fortune cookie brings an unexpected treat, our project delivers surprise rewards to lucky CCTX users!

<br />

## 🎯 Why Fortune Cookie?

## 🎲 How It Works

### 📅 Weekly Draws
Based on statistical analysis, we select winners from a pool of CCTX every week

### 🏅 Multiple Winning Categories
- **🎲 Lucky CCTX** - Randomly selected transactions (VRF-powered)
<br />

- **⚡ Finality Flash** - Fastest transaction finality time per chain
<br />

- **👻 Gas Ghost** - Lowest gas fee transactions per chain
<br />

- **🐢 Tortoise Trophy** - Slowest finality time per chain

<br />

## 🎳 Unpredictable & Fair

Winners are genuinely unpredictable because:
